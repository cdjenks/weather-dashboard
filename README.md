# weather-dashboard

This is a weather dashboard application that allows users to search for cities around the world to the city's weather info. Both day-of weather as well as a five day forecast will be displayed, and searched-for cities are added to a list where they can be reselected later to again view that city's weather. Weather values displayed for day-of are temperature, humidity, wind-speed, and uv index. Also, the uv index is color coded according to severity. The boxes where the 5 day forecast is displayed include temperature and wind speed data.
